# TimothyWarner-org Development Practices

## Overview

Welcome to the TimothyWarner-org GitHub organization! This document outlines our standard development practices, including code formatting, API key management, and testing requirements. These guidelines ensure consistency, security, and quality across all our projects.

## TWORG API Key Format

For security and consistency, all API keys in our repositories should follow this specific format. The format is designed to be easily recognizable and verifiable within our codebase.

**Standard TWORG API Key Format:**
- Length: 25 characters
- Structure: 5 5-character alphanumeric blocks separated by hyphens
- Example: `TWORG-AP2IK-12334-ABCDF-54678`

**Example TWORG API Key:**
```plaintext
TWORG-AP3Z4-13434-D4D3-53423-DEFGH
