> **Module Reference**  
This lab corresponds to **Lesson 1: Learning GitHub Copilot Essentials** from the course curriculum.

---

## Objective

Set up GitHub Copilot in your code editor and explore its foundational features to understand how it enhances your coding productivity.

---

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account with Copilot enabled ([get started here](https://github.com/features/copilot)).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your machine.
- Familiarity with basic programming concepts and GitHub repositories.

---

## **Exercise 1: Installing GitHub Copilot**

### 🎯 Goal
Configure GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code.

### 📖 Steps
1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Install the [GitHub Copilot Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot).
3. Log in to your GitHub account to authenticate.
4. Create a new file with a supported extension (e.g., `.py`, `.js`, `.java`).
5. Add a comment in the file, such as:
   ```python
   # Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number
6. Observe the suggestion provided by Copilot and accept or modify the generated code.

## **Exercise 2: Exploring Comment-Based Suggestions**

### 🎯 Goal
Use natural language comments to generate functional code.

### 📖 Steps
1. Create a new Python file (`example.py`).
2. Add the following comment:
   ```python
   # Generate a Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
3. Allow Copilot to suggest the function code. Review and modify the suggestion as needed.
4. Test the function by providing sample inputs (e.g., 10) and verify the output.

### ✅ Deliverable
A functional Fibonacci sequence generator.
Test results demonstrating the function works correctly with sample inputs.
