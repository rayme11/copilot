> **Module Reference**  
> This lab corresponds to **Lesson 11: Copilot Best Practices** from the course curriculum.

**Duration**: 15 minutes

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:
- Learn security best practices when using Copilot
- Master code quality and maintainability techniques
- Understand how to effectively review Copilot suggestions
- Practice responsible AI-assisted development

## Prerequisites

- GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat installed
- Basic understanding of code security principles
- Familiarity with code quality metrics

## 🔨 Exercises

### Exercise 1: Security-First Development (5 minutes)

1. Review this code with security in mind:
   ```javascript
   // @secure Generate a function to handle user authentication
   function authenticateUser(username, password) {
     // TODO: Implement secure authentication
   }
   ```

2. Use Copilot to identify security issues:
   ```javascript
   // @audit Check for security vulnerabilities:
   const userQuery = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;
   ```

3. Practice secure coding patterns:
   ```javascript
   // @secure Generate a function that:
   // - Sanitizes user input
   // - Uses parameterized queries
   // - Implements rate limiting
   ```

### Exercise 2: Code Quality Patterns (5 minutes)

1. Use quality-focused prompts:
   ```javascript
   // @quality Refactor this function following SOLID principles:
   function processOrder(order, user, payment) {
     // Handles order processing, user notification, and payment
     if (payment.validate()) {
       order.process();
       user.notify();
       payment.execute();
     }
   }
   ```

2. Generate maintainable code:
   ```javascript
   // @pattern Implement using the repository pattern:
   // - User data access
   // - Error handling
   // - Logging
   ```

### Exercise 3: Review and Validation (5 minutes)

1. Practice critical review:
   ```javascript
   // @review Analyze this code for:
   // - Performance implications
   // - Memory usage
   // - Error handling
   function processLargeDataset(data) {
     const results = data.map(item => heavyComputation(item));
     return results.filter(result => result !== null);
   }
   ```

2. Use Copilot to suggest improvements:
   ```javascript
   // @improve Suggest optimizations for:
   // - Resource usage
   // - Code readability
   // - Error recovery
   ```
