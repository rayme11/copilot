# Code Review Guidelines

## Purpose
The purpose of code reviews at Timothy Warner Organization (TWORG) is to improve code quality, ensure consistency, and share knowledge among team members. The following guidelines are designed to facilitate effective and constructive code reviews.

## Before the Review
- **Prepare Your Code**: Ensure that your code is clean, well-documented, and follows the coding standards before submitting it for review.
- **Self-Review**: Perform a self-review to catch obvious issues before requesting a review from others.
- **Provide Context**: When submitting a pull request, provide context in the description to help reviewers understand the changes and their purpose.

## During the Review
- **Focus on Code Quality**: Evaluate the code for readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards.
- **Security Considerations**: Look for potential security vulnerabilities and suggest improvements where necessary.
- **Constructive Feedback**: Provide feedback that is clear, specific, and focused on improving the code. Avoid personal criticism.
- **Ask Questions**: If something is unclear, ask the author for clarification rather than making assumptions.

## After the Review
- **Discuss Feedback**: Engage in a dialogue with the code author to resolve any issues or differences in opinion.
- **Follow Up**: Ensure that any suggested changes are implemented before the code is merged.
- **Continuous Learning**: Use code reviews as an opportunity to learn and improve your own coding practices.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Nitpicking**: Avoid focusing on minor issues that do not significantly impact the codeâ€™s quality or functionality.
- **Overlooking Context**: Consider the context and goals of the changes when reviewing code, rather than applying rules rigidly.
- **Bias**: Be aware of personal biases that may affect your judgment during the review process.
